				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<img src="assets/images/meplaceholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder due to hard drive crash and losing all pictures">
				<p>
				I've been a C++ developer for over 20 years but due to a recent layoff, I am now embarking on expanding my knowledge from just C++ and C# to web development.  My time these days are spent split between job searching, learning the basics of web development, and taking care of my two dogs.</p>
				<p>
				My job consisted of supporting the engineering department (I didn't work for IT) by providing tools that made the engineers life a little easier and keeping the data required by our coverage prediction tool as up to date as possible without spending money.</p>
				<p>
				My dogs are Sussex Spaniels, a rare breed that I now have two of.  If you want a quiet dog that doesn't slobber, don't get one of these.  They like to bark and howl, no they love to bark and howl.</p>
